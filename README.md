# Password Tech
Password Tech is a powerful password generator and password manager for Windows, capable of generating large amounts of cryptographically-secure passwords, pronounceable passwords, pattern-based passwords, passphrases composed of words, and scripted passwords. Passwords can be stored in encrypted databases along with user names, URLs, notes, etc. Password Tech provides lots of options to customize passwords to the users' various needs, and individual scripting with Lua gives full control over the process of password generation. Text encryption is also supported.

Password Tech runs on Windows 10 and later.

## Features

- Full Unicode support
- Cryptographically-secure (using AES, ChaCha20, SHA-256, SHA-512, BLAKE2)
- Password manager that handles encrypted databases
- Databases can be protected by a regular password and/or key file
- In addition to a regular master password, a *recovery password* can be specified
- Passwords composed of different character sets with individual frequencies of occurrence
- Passphrases composed of words from a word list
- Pronounceable passwords
- Pattern-based / formatted passwords
- Password scripting with Lua
- Fully customizable
- Encryption of clipboard text
- Advanced password quality/strength estimation (using the "zxcvbn" method)

## Release Notes

The history of releases of main version 3 is contained in the file *changes.txt*.

## Translations

Available translations / language files can be found in the *languages/* directory. As of version 3.4.5, Password Tech preferantially uses the PO format (.po files) for translations. The custom LNG format (.lng files) is considered deprecated. Password Tech still accepts .lng files, but I recommend all translators to switch over to the PO format at the earliest opportunity. The PO format is more powerful than the custom format and also widely supported by many applications, web services, and editors (such as [POEdit](https://poedit.net)).

To convert existing translations from the LNG to the PO format, load the translation in Password Tech, select *Options | Configuration* in the main menu, go to the *Languages* tab in the Configuration window, and press the *Convert to new PO file format* button.

**Note:** As of version 3.5.3, Password Tech uses format specifiers of the form `%N` to format strings, with *N* being the index of the argument (starting at *N*=1) to be inserted into the formatted string. All arguments are provided as strings by the application. The new format was chosen because it provides higher flexibility and security. Password Tech is still compatible with the old format (`%d` for digits, `%f` for floating point numbers, `%s` for strings, etc.), and the original strings are still provided in the old format to avoid merge conflicts when updating existing translations.

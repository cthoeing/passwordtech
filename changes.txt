                            =============
                Copyright (c) 2002-2025 by Christian Thöing


Version 3.5.9

NEW FEATURES:

- Option "Include Header" (context menu of "Generate" button in main window) to
  include (or disable) information about generated passwords and entropy at the
  beginning of password lists

FIXES:

- Check for updates broken, since version file could not be downloaded anymore

----------

Version 3.5.8 (2025-09-07)

NEW FEATURES:

- Create and restore backup of all program settings (configuration and installed
  language files) via File | Backup Settings, and Restore Settings from Backup
  
FIXES:

- Broken UTF-8 and ANSI encoding when saving passwords to file
- After unlocking database, keyboard shortcuts of selected entry only functional
  after re-selecting entry

----------

Version 3.5.7 (2025-05-11)

NEW FEATURES:

- Character Set Builder: New "Exclude characters" box to exclude custom
  characters from resulting character set
- Password font can be reset to default in main window, password list window,
  and password manager to avoid scaling issues with high-DPI system settings
  
CHANGES & IMPROVEMENTS:

- Configuration | Files | Character encoding: Setting now refers to both
  writing and reading files; when reading files (such as word lists) and byte-
  order mark is not specified, encoding may default to either ANSI or UTF-8

FIXES:

- When combining passwords with passphrases and "Length" requirement enabled,
  passwords are sometimes empty
- Fixed clipping issues of some labels

----------

Version 3.5.6 (2025-01-29)

NEW FEATURES:

- PassCube: Allow keeping list of (up to 10) recently opened databases
- PassCube: New button "Hide notes" (next to Notes box) to hide the text in the
  notes box when the box is out of focus

  icon displayed on the task bar, system tray, etc. during runtime
- Configuration | Language: New "Install" and "Remove" buttons to add or
  remove language files to/from the current PwTech installation
  
CHANGES & IMPROVEMENTS:

- Language files can also be copied to the "AppData" folder (usually
  "C:\Users\{user}\AppData\Roaming\Password Tech"), which makes it easier
  to install new languages if PwTech has been installed to the "Program Files"
  folder (which usually requires admin privileges for write access)

FIXES:

- PO language files with empty fields in header not loaded properly

----------

Version 3.5.4 (2024-02-14)

NEW FEATURES:

- "Include characters" option: New placeholder "<<...>>:N[+]" allows specifying
  custom character set (enclosed within <<...>>) and assigning a frequency
  value N to it (e.g., "<<abcd0123>>:1+" ensures that generated passwords
  contain at least one character from the set "abcd0123")
- Feature "Character Set Builder": New window for composing custom character
  set strings, which can be copied to the "Character set" box in the main window
  (press "Build" button below the "Character set" box)

- PassCube: Applied filter (via View | Filter) displayed in toolbar; can be
  removed by pressing "(x)" button next to "Filtered" label

CHANGES & IMPROVEMENTS:

- Entropy values of passwords displayed with one decimal (e.g., "92.3")
- Format password: More verbose information about invalid specifiers

FIXES:

- Encryption/decryption of text from clipboard not functional

----------

Version 3.5.2 (2023-10-01)

NEW FEATURES:

- Generate multiple passwords: "Generate" button redesigned; arrow button opens
  context menu that allows generating passwords to the clipboard (new) as well
  as generating passwords to a file

CHANGES & IMPROVEMENTS:

- Appropriate reaction to Windows "end session" event (e.g., system shutdown):
  All tasks are canceled, configuration settings are saved, database is closed
  gracefully if possible; otherwise, shutdown is blocked with a corresponding
  message (e.g., if a database entry is being edited and the changes haven't
  been confirmed yet)
- "Advanced Password Option" button in main window displays number of enabled
  (boolean) options and extended tooltip information
- Clear clipboard automatically: Clipboard is only cleared if the SHA-256 hash
  of its contents match the hash of the data that was copied originally

----------

Version 3.5.1 (2023-08-01)

NEW FEATURES:

- New option "Load the following profile on startup" in Configuration | General

CHANGES & IMPROVEMENTS:

- Maximum number of passwords that can be generated at once extended to
  1 trillion (1,000,000,000,000) (note that larger amounts >~10**8 can only be
  stored in files since the number of Unicode characters displayed in the
  password list window is limited to 500 million/2 billion in the 32/64-bit
  version)
- Suffixes "K", "M", "G"/"B" can be specified in the "Multiple passwords" box
  to generate multiples of thousands, millions, and billions, respectively
- Passwords are generated asynchronously in a separate thread, so that progress
  window stays responsive
- Include characters / character sets with different frequencies: Now compatible
  with password option "Each character must occur only once"
- Password manager: When changing number of KDF rounds via File | Database
  Settings, the process can be canceled after 1 sec (in case the number of
  rounds has accidentally been set too high)

FIXES:

- Launching PwTech on system startup caused an error (configuration file and/or
  randseed.dat file not found)
- Fixed potential buffer overflows

----------

  characters for placeholders by using the syntax <placeholder>:N[+], e.g.
  <symbols>:2+ (meaning "Include at least two special symbols") 
- Advanced password options: New option "Assign entropy value to each entry in
  password list"
- PassCube: New field "Password changed" (date & time of last password change)
- PassCube: New field "Password history" (history of up to 255 previous
  passwords and associated date & time values)
- PassCube: New option "For new entries, save the following number of previous
  passwords" in Database Settings
  
CHANGES & IMPROVEMENTS:

- Random pool: Cryptographic hash function HMAC-SHA-256 replaced with BLAKE2s
  for enhanced security and speed
  
FIXES:

- Fixed potential buffer overflows
- Cannot generate passphrases if word list size is exactly 2**N with 17<=N<=20
- PassCube: Various issues selecting database entries

----------

Version 3.4.5 (2023-01-22)

NEW FEATURES:

- PassCube password manager: Added option to compress database file using the
  "Deflate" algorithm; available in File | Database Settings | Compression
- PassCube: When editing a database entry, password needs to be confirmed in a
  separate dialog if it has been changed manually and if it is hidden in the box
- PassCube: "Quality bar" below the password box in the edit panel illustrates
  the estimated quality/security of an entry's password
- PassCube: Added button next to URL box for opening the specified URL

  entries in PassCube

CHANGES & IMPROVEMENTS:

- Reworked password quality bar such that the color gradient ranges from 0 bits
  (red/orange) to 64 bits (midpoint, yellow) to 128+ bits (green); the quality
  rating is stricter now since the green color starts to become visible at
  ~75 bits instead of ~55 bits
- Translations: Changed custom LNG format to PO (GNU gettext) format, which is
  widely supported by many applications and web services, allowing translators
  to use dedicated editors such as "Poedit"
  NOTE FOR TRANSLATORS: Existing translations in the LNG format (.lng file) can
  be converted into the new PO format (.po file) by loading the translation in
  PwTech, selecting the corresponding language in the drop-down box (Options |
  Configuration | Language), and pressing the button "Convert to new PO file
  format"
- Format password: Made format specifier <<...>> compatible with options
  "asterisk (*)" and "random number from range", so that format sequences such
  as *1-26<<<az>>> ("Randomly permute letters a..z and insert a random number
  between 1 and 26 of permuted characters into the password") are functional

----------

Version 3.4.4 (2022-10-03)

- PassCube: Recovery password (and/or key file) can be configured to enable
  recovery of the database in case the regular master password has been lost;
  databases can then be opened using either password; alternatively, the
  recovery password may function as an "administrator key" to allow individuals
  with elevated rights to access all databases in an organization (provided that
  all databases have been set up with the same recovery password)  
- PassCube: Remember last selected entry and tag(s) when locking database

CHANGES & IMPROVEMENTS:

- PassCube: Changed HMAC algorithm (to protect data integrity and authenticity)
  from SHA-256 to SHA-512 in new version of database format (1.3)
- PassCube: Search options "Fuzzy" and "Case sensitive" moved to context menu,
  which can be accessed by right-clicking on the search button in the toolbar

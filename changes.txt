                            =============
                Copyright (c) 2002-2024 by Christian Thöing


Version 3.5.4

NEW FEATURES:

- "Include characters" option: New placeholder "<<...>>:N[+]" allows specifying
  custom character set (enclosed within <<...>>) and assigning a frequency
  value N to it (e.g., "<<abcd0123>>:1+" ensures that generated passwords
  contain at least one character from the set "abcd0123")
- Feature "Character Set Builder": New window for composing custom character
  set strings, which can be copied to the "Character set" box in the main window
  (press "Build" button below the "Character set" box)

----------

Version 3.5.3 (2023-12-03)

NEW FEATURES:

- Advanced Password Options: New option "Include at least one character from
  each subset"
- Advanced Password Options: Min./max. length of words in word lists; upper
  limit increased to 100 (previously 30)
- Advanced Password Options: Redefine separators in passphrases, i.e.,
  separator between words and between words and characters (when combining
  words with characters from password)
- PassCube: New filter option "Entries with weak passwords" (View | Filter)
- PassCube: Applied filter (via View | Filter) displayed in toolbar; can be
  removed by pressing "(x)" button next to "Filtered" label

CHANGES & IMPROVEMENTS:

- Entropy values of passwords displayed with one decimal (e.g., "92.3")
- Format password: More verbose information about invalid specifiers

FIXES:

- Encryption/decryption of text from clipboard not functional

----------

Version 3.5.2 (2023-10-01)

NEW FEATURES:

- Generate multiple passwords: "Generate" button redesigned; arrow button opens
  context menu that allows generating passwords to the clipboard (new) as well
  as generating passwords to a file

CHANGES & IMPROVEMENTS:

- Appropriate reaction to Windows "end session" event (e.g., system shutdown):
  All tasks are canceled, configuration settings are saved, database is closed
  gracefully if possible; otherwise, shutdown is blocked with a corresponding
  message (e.g., if a database entry is being edited and the changes haven't
  been confirmed yet)
- "Advanced Password Option" button in main window displays number of enabled
  (boolean) options and extended tooltip information
- Clear clipboard automatically: Clipboard is only cleared if the SHA-256 hash
  of its contents match the hash of the data that was copied originally
- External Windows dialogs (e.g., file open/save dialogs) have the same style
  as the selected user interface style (Configuration | General)
- PassCube: Database settings: Changing "Number of key derivation rounds" can
  be canceled in case the parameter has accidentally been set too large
  
FIXES:

- "Clear password box automatically" settings not saved to configuration file
- PassCube: Database not locked when minimizing window
- PassCube: Wrong position of "Enter password" dialog when restoring window
  and unlocking database
- PassCube: "Save automatically" settings not saved to configuration file

----------

Version 3.5.1 (2023-08-01)

NEW FEATURES:

- New option "Load the following profile on startup" in Configuration | General

CHANGES & IMPROVEMENTS:

- Maximum number of passwords that can be generated at once extended to
  1 trillion (1,000,000,000,000) (note that larger amounts >~10**8 can only be
  stored in files since the number of Unicode characters displayed in the
  password list window is limited to 500 million/2 billion in the 32/64-bit
  version)
- Suffixes "K", "M", "G"/"B" can be specified in the "Multiple passwords" box
  to generate multiples of thousands, millions, and billions, respectively
- Passwords are generated asynchronously in a separate thread, so that progress
  window stays responsive
- Include characters / character sets with different frequencies: Now compatible
  with password option "Each character must occur only once"
- Password manager: When changing number of KDF rounds via File | Database
  Settings, the process can be canceled after 1 sec (in case the number of
  rounds has accidentally been set too high)

FIXES:

- Launching PwTech on system startup caused an error (configuration file and/or
  randseed.dat file not found)
- Fixed potential buffer overflows

----------

Version 3.5.0 (2023-04-10)

NEW FEATURES:

- New high-resolution icons
- Style of user interface can be customized, list of styles available in
  Configuration | General, including dark styles
- Password generator, Include characters: Specify (minimum or fixed) number of
  characters for placeholders by using the syntax <placeholder>:N[+], e.g.
  <symbols>:2+ (meaning "Include at least two special symbols") 
- Advanced password options: New option "Assign entropy value to each entry in
  password list"
- PassCube: New field "Password changed" (date & time of last password change)
- PassCube: New field "Password history" (history of up to 255 previous
  passwords and associated date & time values)
- PassCube: New option "For new entries, save the following number of previous
  passwords" in Database Settings
  
CHANGES & IMPROVEMENTS:

- Random pool: Cryptographic hash function HMAC-SHA-256 replaced with BLAKE2s
  for enhanced security and speed
  
FIXES:

- Fixed potential buffer overflows
- Cannot generate passphrases if word list size is exactly 2**N with 17<=N<=20
- PassCube: Various issues selecting database entries

----------

Version 3.4.5 (2023-01-22)

NEW FEATURES:

- PassCube password manager: Added option to compress database file using the
  "Deflate" algorithm; available in File | Database Settings | Compression
- PassCube: When editing a database entry, password needs to be confirmed in a
  separate dialog if it has been changed manually and if it is hidden in the box
- PassCube: "Quality bar" below the password box in the edit panel illustrates
  the estimated quality/security of an entry's password
- PassCube: Added button next to URL box for opening the specified URL
- Advanced password strength estimation ("zxcvbn" algorithm) can be enabled in
  Configuration | Security; it is applied for passwords entered by the user into
  the password box in the main window, as well as for passwords of database
  entries in PassCube

CHANGES & IMPROVEMENTS:

- Reworked password quality bar such that the color gradient ranges from 0 bits
  (red/orange) to 64 bits (midpoint, yellow) to 128+ bits (green); the quality
  rating is stricter now since the green color starts to become visible at
  ~75 bits instead of ~55 bits
- Translations: Changed custom LNG format to PO (GNU gettext) format, which is
  widely supported by many applications and web services, allowing translators
  to use dedicated editors such as "Poedit"
  NOTE FOR TRANSLATORS: Existing translations in the LNG format (.lng file) can
  be converted into the new PO format (.po file) by loading the translation in
  PwTech, selecting the corresponding language in the drop-down box (Options |
  Configuration | Language), and pressing the button "Convert to new PO file
  format"
- Format password: Made format specifier <<...>> compatible with options
  "asterisk (*)" and "random number from range", so that format sequences such
  as *1-26<<<az>>> ("Randomly permute letters a..z and insert a random number
  between 1 and 26 of permuted characters into the password") are functional

----------

Version 3.4.4 (2022-10-03)

NEW FEATURES:

- PassCube password manager: Databases can be protected by key files in addition
  to or in place of a regular password; password entry dialog allows selection
  of key files and creation of new 256-bit key files
- PassCube: Recovery password (and/or key file) can be configured to enable
  recovery of the database in case the regular master password has been lost;
  databases can then be opened using either password; alternatively, the
  recovery password may function as an "administrator key" to allow individuals
  with elevated rights to access all databases in an organization (provided that
  all databases have been set up with the same recovery password)  
- PassCube: Remember last selected entry and tag(s) when locking database

CHANGES & IMPROVEMENTS:

- PassCube: Changed HMAC algorithm (to protect data integrity and authenticity)
  from SHA-256 to SHA-512 in new version of database format (1.3)
- PassCube: Search options "Fuzzy" and "Case sensitive" moved to context menu,
  which can be accessed by right-clicking on the search button in the toolbar

  Properties..."
